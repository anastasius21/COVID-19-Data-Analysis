# COVID-19-Data-Analysis
This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing COVID-19 cases and deaths using Pandas and Matplotlib. It provides visualizations in the form of pie charts for both worldwide and country-specific COVID-19 statistics. There are two Script files (.py )and two notebooks (.ipynb) for the same Script files. The two files are named Covid19_Stats_Worldwide and Covid19_Stats_CountryWise respectively.  
# Covid19_Stats_Worldwide
This python code uses Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize the dataset of COVID 19 as taken from the [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/data) website and then displaying the stats using a pie chart. The Pie Chart visualizes the total percentage of cases and Deaths worldwide.
# Covid19_Stats_CountryWise
This python code uses pandas and Matplotlib to visualize the dataset of COVID 19 as taken from the [World Health Organization (WHO) website](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/data) and then displaying the stats using pie charts. The code pushes the user to enter the country name and then displays the pie chart against it.
